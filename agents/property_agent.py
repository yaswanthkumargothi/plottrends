            1. ONLY analyze plots from the above JSON data that match the user's requirements:
               - Property Category: {property_category}
               - Maximum Price: {max_price} crores

            Please provide your analysis in this format:
            
            First, create a wrapper div with class="card-container" and inside it, create 5 HTML divs (one for each plot) with class="property-card" using this structure:
            
            <div class="card-container">
              <div class="property-card">

                  <p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> DIMENSIONS</p>

            </div>
            
            DO NOT wrap this HTML in triple backticks or markdown code blocks.
            Make sure you replace PROPERTY_URL with the actual URL from the property data.
            The "View Details" button must be an actual <a> link tag, not just a div.
            
            Then, AFTER the card container div, start a new section with "---ANALYSIS_SECTION_BELOW---" followed by your analysis text.
